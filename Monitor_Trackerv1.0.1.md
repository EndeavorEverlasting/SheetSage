# Automated Notes Protection and Update Script

This script is designed to manage and update the "Automated Notes" column in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It provides functionality for protecting the column against unauthorized edits and dynamically updating its contents based on other columns' data. The script includes features for logging, error handling, and compatibility with dynamic headers.

---

## Features

### 1. **Protection of "Automated Notes" Column**
- Protects the "Automated Notes" column in all sheets except the penultimate tab.
- Applies a warning for edits even by the owner.
- Dynamically locates the "Automated Notes" column based on its header.

### 2. **Dynamic Updates to Automated Notes**
- Updates the "Automated Notes" column based on the presence or absence of data in specific columns (e.g., Location, Serial, Asset Tag, Hostname).
- Supports the following statuses:
  - **Complete**: All required fields are populated.
  - **Sufficient**: Missing location but other fields are populated.
  - **Missing**: Identifies which fields are missing.
  
### 3. **Logging with Traces and Spans**
- Generates a unique trace ID for each script run.
- Logs key actions and errors, making debugging easier.

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Skips sheets without the "Automated Notes" header.
- Logs missing critical headers or unexpected data formats.
- Safeguards against overwriting when live formulas are present.

### 5. **Dynamic Header Detection**
- Dynamically detects headers regardless of column position.
- Ensures flexibility when columns are rearranged.

### 6. **Automated Issue Detection**
- Logs and flags issues such as missing headers and invalid data formats.

## Usage

### Execution Steps
1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet.
2. Navigate to the Script Editor (`Extensions > Apps Script`).
3. Copy and paste the script into the editor.
4. Save the script and authorize necessary permissions.
5. Run the `myFunction()` function to execute the script.

### Expected Behavior
- The script will:
  1. Protect the "Automated Notes" column in applicable sheets.
  2. Update notes dynamically based on other column data.
  3. Skip updates if the column already contains a live formula.

## Implementation Details

### Key Functions

#### `myFunction()`
- Orchestrates the execution of protection and updates.
- Generates a trace ID for logging.

#### `protectAutomatedNotesColumn(traceId)`
- Applies protection to the "Automated Notes" column.
- Skips protection for specific sheets (e.g., penultimate tab, "Count").

#### `updateAutomatedNotes(traceId)`
- Dynamically updates the "Automated Notes" column based on data in other columns.
- Skips updates if live formulas are present in the column.

#### Utility Functions
- `generateTraceId()`: Creates a unique identifier for logging purposes.
- `startSpan()`, `endSpan()`, `logError()`: Manage detailed logging.
- `getHeaderRow(sheet)`: Dynamically retrieves the header row.
- `isProtectedSheet(sheetName, totalSheets, index)`: Determines if a sheet should be skipped.
- `getExistingProtection(sheet, range)`: Finds existing protections for a range.

## Example Data Format
| Location      | Serial             | Asset Tag | Hostname     | Automated Notes     |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Front Desk 1  | 123456789          | M12345    | HOST001      | Complete            |
| Front Desk 2  | 987654321          | M67890    | HOST002      | Sufficient: Missing Loc |
|               |                    |           |              | Missing: Loc, Serial, Asset, Host |

## Known Limitations
- Does not update sheets with missing "Automated Notes" headers.
- Skips updates if a live formula is detected in column G.
- Requires manual execution unless scheduled via Apps Script triggers.

## Future Improvements
- Add email notifications for flagged issues.
- Extend functionality to support additional column dependencies.
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
