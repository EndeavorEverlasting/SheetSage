# Use Cases for Enhanced Google Apps Script

## 1. **Protecting the "Automated Notes" Column**
   - Ensures that the "Automated Notes" column (Column G) in all sheets is protected.
   - Prevents accidental or unauthorized edits by removing all editors except the script owner.
   - Automatically applies protection settings across all sheets within the spreadsheet.
   - Logs the status of protection for each sheet:
     - Identifies and applies protection if the "Automated Notes" column exists.
     - Skips empty sheets or sheets without the "Automated Notes" title.

---

## 2. **Updating Automated Notes**
   - Dynamically evaluates each row in the spreadsheet to determine the status of deployment tuples.
   - Marks rows based on the following conditions:
     - **Complete**: All four fields (Location, Serial, Asset Tag, Host) are present.
     - **Sufficient**: Serial, Asset Tag, and Host are present but Location is missing.
     - **Missing**: Identifies and specifies missing components (e.g., "Missing: Loc, Host").
   - Writes the status into the "Automated Notes" column (Column G).

## 3. **Handling Multiple Sheets**
   - Iterates through all sheets in the spreadsheet.
   - Automatically applies the "Automated Notes" update and protection logic to every sheet.
   - Skips empty sheets or sheets without relevant data.
   - Logs processing status for each sheet.

---

## 4. **Dynamic Deployment Tuple Counting**
   - Counts deployments based on the presence of Serial, Asset Tag, and Host components.
   - Provides clear visibility into the completeness of deployment data for rows with:
     - Full tuples (Complete status).
     - Partial tuples (Sufficient status).
     - Missing data (specific notes indicating missing fields).

---

## 5. **Logging and Debugging**
   - Logs detailed information about:
     - The status of each sheet during protection and update processes.
     - Row-specific details about what data is missing or complete.
     - Existing protections found and reused for efficiency.

---

## 6. **Error Prevention**
   - Prevents overwriting or editing critical columns (e.g., "Automated Notes").
   - Ensures that all changes to the "Automated Notes" column are programmatically controlled for consistency and accuracy.

---

## 7. **Data Integrity**
   - Maintains accurate deployment records by clearly marking rows with sufficient or complete tuples.
   - Identifies incomplete rows for further review or correction by specifying missing fields in the notes.

---

## 8. **Scalability**
   - Supports any number of sheets within the spreadsheet.
   - Easily adaptable for additional logic or fields in the future.
   - Designed to handle varying data sizes and structures across sheets.

---

## 9. **Streamlined Workflow**
   - Reduces manual effort in tracking and updating deployment statuses.
   - Ensures a uniform approach to protecting and annotating data across all sheets.
   - Facilitates quick identification of rows that need attention.

---

## 10. **Multi-User Collaboration**
   - Supports collaboration in shared spreadsheets by preventing unauthorized edits.
   - Ensures that only the script owner can modify critical data, maintaining the integrity of the "Automated Notes" column.

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Add email notifications for rows with incomplete data for follow-up.
- Integrate with external systems (e.g., inventory databases) to validate tuples automatically.
- Expand logic to include additional fields or criteria for "Complete" or "Sufficient" statuses.
