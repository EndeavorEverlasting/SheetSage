# Automated Notes Protection and Update Script - Monitor_Trackerv1.0.2

This script manages and updates the "Automated Notes" column in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It protects the column against unauthorized edits, dynamically updates its contents based on other columns' data, and includes enhanced features for logging, error handling, and compatibility with dynamic headers.

---

## Features

### 1. **Enhanced Protection of "Automated Notes" Column**
- Protects the "Automated Notes" column in all sheets except "Count."
- Applies warning-only protection for all users, including the owner.
- Dynamically identifies and protects the column based on its header location.
- Introduces robust logging to identify skipped protections.

### 2. **Dynamic Updates to Automated Notes**
- Updates the "Automated Notes" column based on the presence or absence of data in specific columns (e.g., Location, Serial, Asset Tag, Hostname).
- Supports the following statuses:
  - **Complete**: All required fields are populated.
  - **Sufficient**: Missing location but other fields are populated.
  - **Missing**: Identifies missing fields dynamically.
- Skips updates if the column already contains a live formula.

### 3. **Advanced Logging**
- Generates unique trace IDs for each execution.
- Logs key actions and errors to simplify debugging.
- Provides detailed insights for each protection and formula application.

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Skips sheets without the "Automated Notes" header.
- Detects and logs missing headers or invalid data formats.
- Prevents overwriting live formulas in the column.

### 5. **Dynamic Header Detection**
- Automatically detects headers, ensuring flexibility even if columns are rearranged.
- Skips sheets that do not have the required headers.

### 6. **Protection Logging**
- Logs detailed information about existing protections.
- Reports newly applied protections for better tracking.

## Usage

### Execution Steps
1. Open your Google Sheets spreadsheet.
2. Navigate to the Script Editor (`Extensions > Apps Script`).
3. Copy and paste the script into the editor.
4. Save the script and authorize necessary permissions.
5. Run the `myFunction()` function to execute the script.

### Expected Behavior
- The script will:
  1. Protect the "Automated Notes" column in applicable sheets.
  2. Update notes dynamically based on column data.
  3. Log detailed information for every action performed.

## Implementation Details

### Key Functions

#### `myFunction()`
- Orchestrates the execution of protections and updates.
- Generates a trace ID for consistent logging.

#### `preserveHeaders(traceId)`
- Verifies the presence of headers in all sheets except "Count."
- Logs missing headers for debugging.

#### `applyWarningOnlyProtection(traceId)`
- Applies warning-only protection to the "Automated Notes" column.
- Skips sheets without the header or named "Count."

#### `applyOwnerOnlyProtection(traceId)`
- Adds owner-only edit permissions for the "Automated Notes" column.
- Skips sheets without the header or named "Count."

#### `applyFormulaToColumnG(traceId)`
- Dynamically updates the "Automated Notes" column (Column G) with a formula.
- Skips updates if a live formula already exists.

#### `checkExistingProtections(traceId)`
- Logs all existing protections in the spreadsheet.

#### Utility Functions
- `generateTraceId()`: Creates a unique ID for each execution.
- `startSpan()` and `endSpan()`: Manage span logging for better traceability.
- `logError(traceId, context, error)`: Logs errors with context for debugging.
- `getHeaderRow(sheet)`: Dynamically retrieves the header row for a given sheet.

## Example Data Format

| Location      | Serial             | Asset Tag | Hostname     | Automated Notes     |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Front Desk 1  | 123456789          | M12345    | HOST001      | Complete            |
| Front Desk 2  | 987654321          | M67890    | HOST002      | Sufficient: Missing Loc |
|               |                    |           |              | Missing: Loc, Serial, Asset, Host |

## Known Limitations
- Skips updates for sheets with missing headers.
- Requires manual execution unless scheduled via Apps Script triggers.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add automatic scheduling for periodic execution.
- Enhance performance for larger datasets.
